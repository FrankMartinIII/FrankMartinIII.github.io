We are developing a robot that can deliver injections. Our goal is to make robots that be easily controlled by human operators and doctors. I wanted to take on the challenging task of building a system that naturally fits into a clinical setting without too much change the routine of medical staff. To integrate a robot for injection as seamlessly as possible, it was logical to me that we would want to allow doctors and nurses to easily mark an area on the skin, akin to what they might do before a surgical procedure, and have the robotic system automatically acquire and track the region of interest from these markings. 

I came up with multiple ideas to accomplish this, conducting many experiments with ellipse fitting, circle detection, and contour tracking. Ultimately, we settled on the idea of using an X shape. Why? An X is easy for a human to draw, has an exact point of interest, and is intuitive for a human to understand. Regardless of the size and shape of the X, it is obvious that the injection should be delivered at the intersection point, though detecting this with computer vision and retrieving a full 6 degree-of-freedom pose is more challenging.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
