At Hofstra, we have developed several robotic systems designed to assist surgeons with closing wounds. To accomplish this task, the system takes a 3D scan of the wound and places magnetic fixtures on the around the wound's surface. To allow surgeons to interact with the robotic system, we created an XR application for the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

The system sends the wound model and suggested fixture placements to the HoloLens application, displaying them in full 3D in the environment. The user can then manipulate the wound and fixture placements using their hands to correct any errors made by the system. When the user is ready, they can confirm the fixture placements, sending the positions and rotations back to the robot for placement.
