Snow squalls are short periods of intense snowfall. These events create dangerous driving conditions due to slick, icy roads and low visibility. At Hofstra, <a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/faculty-profile/?id=6053">Dr. Bernhardt</a> and I set out to create a simulation that replicates the experience of encountering a snow squall while on the road without the associated risk. Our immersive application can help drivers to understand the risks of snow squalls and be better prepared to take safe and effective action to reduce the risk of accidents. <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/9642051659157182/">It is available on the Meta Quest store.</a>

Our project was funded by the <a href="https://www.nsc.org/newsroom/2024-road-to-zero-community-traffic-grant-winners?srsltid=AfmBOooyWGNTrF2DfJfRd35DznS9zSWjhZZ3vWtyXxnPlY9o3Xapzw_3">National Safety Council Road to Zero grant</a>. We collaborated with the National Weather Service for this project and have a [webpage with more snow squall information on their website](https://www.weather.gov/ctp/snowsquall).

Similarly to our previous rip current simulation, we worked with native Spanish-language speakers to translate the simulation. I used this opportunity to study the different ways in which English and Spanish-speaking groups relate to the same virtual reality simulation—something that has rarely been considered in existing research.

I also created a web-based version of the simulation that is playable without a virtual reality headset. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/snow-squall-webgl/index.html">It is available here</a>.

We surveyed over 200 participants using this simulation around Pennsylvania and New York.
