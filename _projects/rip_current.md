Rip currents are a persistent danger to beach-goers in the United States. Dr. Bernhardt and I are trying to tackle this problem by allowing the public to experience the dangers of rip currents from the safety of a virtual reality headset. I developed this rip current simulation using Unity for the Meta Quest 2 headset and worked with a translator to localize it for Spanish-speakers. The simulation features intuitive motion controls and is available in both English and Spanish. <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6879084558796475/">It is available on the Meta Quest store.</a>



Additionally, we worked with the <a href="https://www.jesanismithfoundation.org/">Je'Sani Smith Foundation</a> in Galveston, Texas and <a href="https://nystateparks.blog/2025/07/16/how-to-break-the-grip-of-the-rip-current/">New York State Parks</a> to deploy the simulation in places where it will continue to be accessible to the general public.

The simulation first takes participants through two training scenes to learn how to swim and wave for help using the motion controls. I also included optional button controls to make sure the application is accessible to as many people as possible. 

We used this simulation to survey local groups and gather feedback on the new rip current signage in Spanish. Read more about this in our article in <i>Weather, Climate, and Society.</i>
