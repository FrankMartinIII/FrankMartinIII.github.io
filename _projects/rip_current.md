Rip currents are a persistent danger to beach-goers in the United States. <a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/faculty-profile/?id=6053">Dr. Bernhardt</a> and I are trying to tackle this problem by allowing the public to experience the dangers of rip currents from the safety of a virtual reality headset. I developed this rip current simulation using Unity for the Meta Quest 2 headset and worked with a translator to localize it for Spanish-speakers. The simulation features intuitive motion controls and is available in both English and Spanish. <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6879084558796475/">It is available on the Meta Quest store.</a>



Additionally, we worked with the <a href="https://www.jesanismithfoundation.org/">Je'Sani Smith Foundation</a> in Galveston, Texas and <a href="https://nystateparks.blog/2025/07/16/how-to-break-the-grip-of-the-rip-current/">New York State Parks</a> to deploy the simulation in places where it will continue to be accessible to the general public.

The simulation first takes participants through two training scenes to learn how to swim and wave for help using the motion controls. I also included optional button controls to make sure the application is accessible to as many people as possible. 

Previously, Spanish NOAA warning signs had a multitude of translation issues and referred to rip currents as <i>corrientes de resaca</i>, which, to some native Spanish-speaking groups, is a term used commonly for hangovers [1]. This did not properly convey the hazardous nature of rip currents. We used this simulation to survey local groups and gather feedback on the new rip current terminology in Spanish, now translated as <i>corrientes marinas</i>. 

64 high school students (a population highly vulnerable to rip currents) were surveyed using the simulation. When asked to rate "how likely did the simulation make you think that you could be caught in a rip current?" on a Likert-scale from 1 to 5, the average response was a 3.6. This indicates the virtual reality simulation successfully demonstrated risk and raised awareness about the hazardous nature of rip currents [2]. Read more about this in our article in <i>Weather, Climate, and Society</i> [2].
