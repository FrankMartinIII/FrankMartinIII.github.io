      abstract = {Rip currents present a considerable risk to beachgoers with approximately 100 fatalities occurring each year in the United States. Furthermore, a general misunderstanding of the term and lack of awareness increases the preventable impacts of rips. While risk communication is often conducted by governmental organizations, Spanish-speaking communities have been underserved by weather outreach, including rip currents. Over 6 months, 279 surveys were collected to assess the effectiveness of the NOAA and U.S. Lifesaving Association (USLA) Spanish-translated rip current beach sign. While a significant portion of the respondents could not accurately define a rip current, the updated term corrientes marinas was more understood than previous Spanish terms for rip current used by outreach products. However, further communication issues exist including providing links to English websites and general confusion on what the outreach is trying to convey. Improvements were also made, based on previous feedback, to a Spanish rip current virtual reality (VR) simulation, which was assessed as successful in portraying the risk of being caught in a rip to users. While signs and VR are effective risk communication tools, it is important to understand the way in which language is being conveyed to the users and how to best reach the appropriate audience.},

  title={Miniaturization of Robotic Wound Closure System: End-Effector Development},
  journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},

  abstract={Robots specialized for surgical applications have the possibility to outperform human surgeons in consistency and create a reduction in surgery time. Previous work has been done at Hofstra University in designing a prototype gantry robotic wound closure system. This system required refinement to bring it closer to a device that could be used in a more realistic medical scenario. Therefore, the goal of this portion of the project is to redesign the system to make it smaller and more portable. The device is composed of several modules. The focus of this work is on fine control of an end-effector and the wound-fixture-applier. The new design of the wound fixture applier has two stepper motors and the controller that tracks a commanded position is written in ROS (Robot Operating System). ROS is a structured communications layer for robotic systems. It is a standard and appropriate piece of software for systems in the industry, such as the system discussed herein. An algorithm was developed to intersperse the stepping of each stepper motor, with each moving a small number of steps so that they complete operation in a similar amount of time regardless of how much each stepper motor must turn and without introducing error. Control of the end-effector requires six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) to provide the flexibility to place fixtures on a large variety of wound topographies and eventually manipulate various instruments other than just the wound-fixture applier. The mechanism selected to achieve this was a Stewart platform. The Stewart platform provides finer control than previous solutions. This is achieved using six linear servo motors acting as the legs of the platform. The linear servo motors must operate simultaneously for proper manipulation of the connected platform to take place. Calculations were preformed to determine the attachment points of the linear servo motors as well as the inverse kinematics of the platform. This was used to write the code for the manipulation of the platform using C++.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
